# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!
<br>
Hi there! ðŸ˜Š This is my very first C++ project, developed during my freshman year at university. I chose to create this classic Tic Tac Toe game because itâ€™s simple, fun, and a great way to learn about programming fundamentals. This project is close to my heart because it represents the beginning of my coding journey, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with you.
<br><hr>
**About the Game:**
<br><hr>
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game. Each player takes turns placing their marker (either 'O' or 'X') in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to line up three markers in a row, column, or diagonal. If all nine spots are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
<br>

**Features of the Project:**
<br><hr>
1.   Interactive Gameplay:
     <br>
   - The game allows two players to play turn by turn, adding their markers to the grid.
     <br>
   - Players are prompted to input their desired position (1â€“9), and the board updates dynamically.
     <br>

2.   Input Validation:
     <br>
   - Ensures players can't overwrite each otherâ€™s moves or choose invalid positions.
     <br>
   - Invalid inputs are gracefully handled with clear error messages.
     <br>

3.   Winning Logic:
     <br>
   - Checks for all possible win conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals) after each move.
     <br>
   - Announces the winner as soon as the game is over.
     <br>

4.   Game Interface:
     <br>
   - The board updates after every turn, showing the current state of the game.
     <br>
   - Easy-to-understand visuals make it accessible for everyone.
     <br>

5.   End Game Scenarios:
     <br>
   - Displays a congratulatory message for the winner.
     <br>
   - Handles draws with a friendly "It's a Draw!" message.
     <br>

6.   Color and Style:
     <br>
   - Adds a touch of style with a purple background (using `system("color 5F")`) to make the game more visually appealing.
<br><hr>
**How to Play:**
<br><hr>
1. Launch the program in any C++ compiler or terminal.<br>
2. Follow the prompts to input your choice of position (1-9).<br>
3. The game alternates between Player 1 (O) and Player 2 (X).<br>
4. Enjoy the game and see who wins!

**What I Learned:**
<br><hr>
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:<br>
- Using arrays to represent game states.<br>
- Implementing loops and conditional statements for control flow.<br>
- Writing functions to organize code and improve readability.<br>
- Validating user inputs to avoid errors.<br>
- Handling win/draw logic systematically.
<br><hr>

**A Personal Note:**
<br><hr>
As a beginner, coding this game was both challenging and rewarding. Itâ€™s amazing how a few lines of code can bring a game to life. I hope this project inspires others starting their journey to try, fail, and keep going. The small victories, like seeing "Player 1 Won!" on the screen, mean so much when youâ€™re just starting out.
<br>

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project! If you have any feedback or ideas to improve this game, Iâ€™d love to hear them. ðŸ˜Š
<br>

Happy gaming! ðŸŽ®

*Future Improvements:*
<br><hr>
While this version works great, thereâ€™s always room to grow! Some potential updates Iâ€™d like to explore include:
<br>
- Adding a single-player mode with AI.
  <br>
- Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more polished look.
  <br>
- Extending it to a 4x4 or larger grid for advanced gameplay.
  <br>

Stay tuned for updates as I learn and improve! ðŸ™Œ
<br>
<br>
Enjoy the game, and may the best player win! âœ¨
